# Movie Search and Watchlist Application

This project features an advanced movie search app with infinite scroll for favorites and search results. It includes a movie details page with server-side rendering (ISR), and a watchlist page where users can add or remove movies. Users can manage their watchlists using local storage, with a random user ID generated for each new user.

- **Movie Details Page**: Implemented with server-side ISR for optimal performance.

### Note:
I didn't have the chance to touch on more advanced features due to time constraints.
